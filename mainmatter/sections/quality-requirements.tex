\section{Software Quality Attributes} \label{sec:software_quality_attributes}

% Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
% important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
% adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
% maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
% and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
% possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
% such as ease of use over ease of learning.

\subsection{Modular Design}
The various sub-systems of the OpenDiablo2 engine should be modular, eg. they
implement an interface. This makes the engine flexible, and codebase robust,
with the ability to adapt to future hardware and software environments not defined
within this document.

For example, regardless of the rendering backend implementation (Vulkan, OpenGL, 
Metal), the rest of the engine sub-systems should be able to carry out their
responsibilities, with little changes required outside of the rendering system.
