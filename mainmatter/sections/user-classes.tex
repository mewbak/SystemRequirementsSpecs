\subsection{End-User (Player)}
End-users's are the primary user class of the OpenDiablo2 engine; they just want
to kill demons and collect loot. We do not assume them to have any particular
technical expertise. With this in mind,  prebuilt binaries will be provided to 
remove the burden of compilation from the end-user.

TODO

\subsection{Modder}
Modders are those individuals that will alter game content to extend the game
(ie. changing quests, adding items, adding new character classes, etc).
TODO: explain more about modding facilities provided by the engine, and the
responsibilities of the modder.

\subsection{Game Developer}
Game developers would use the codebase, but extend it even further, to create
more games like Diablo II by extending the OpenDiablo2 game engine. These users
are programmers and fiends.
