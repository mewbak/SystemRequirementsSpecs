\section{Major Functions} \label{sec:product_functions}

% Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
% perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
% (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
% understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
% related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow 
% diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.
