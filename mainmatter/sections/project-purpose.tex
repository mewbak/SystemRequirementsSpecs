The purpose of the OpenDiablo2 project is to replace the original Diablo II
game engine with a new, high-performance engine which runs on x86\_64 and Arm64
processor architectures, on all three of the popular operating systems currently
in use today: Windows, MacOS, and Debian Linux.

One of the immediate benefits to open-sourcing the Diablo II game engine is that
it opens up a new world for the Diablo II community in terms of extending the
game with new content and functionality.
