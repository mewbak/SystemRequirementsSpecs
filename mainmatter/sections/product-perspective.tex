\section{Perspective} \label{sec:product_perspective}

% Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
% For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
% family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
% product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
% requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
% identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
% components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
% interfaces can be helpful.

The original Diablo II, created by Blizzard Entertainment in June 2000, is
becoming harder, if not impossible, to run on modern platforms. As of June 2020,
Apple has officially removed the ability to execute Win32 binaries on MacOS
Catalina. This is extremely troubling for end-users, as Blizzard continues to
sell Diablo II.

The OpenDiablo2 engine is a drop-in replacement for the original Diablo II game
engine (the executable binaries, dll's, etc.). The OpenDiablo2 engine reads the
game file data from MPQ files. MPQ files are Blizzard's proprietary file format,
which stores all game assets used by the original Diablo II game engine. The
main assumption of the project is that end-users own, and are in possession of,
their own copies of the MPQ files.

The OpenDiablo2 game engine will contain all single-player and Local Area Network 
(LAN) multiplayer functionality present in Diablo II v1.14d.
