\section{User Interfaces} \label{sec:user_interfaces}

% Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software 
% product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI 
% standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen 
% layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will 
% appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, 
% and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is 
% needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a 
% separate user interface specification.
