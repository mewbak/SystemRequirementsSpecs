\section{Software Interfaces} \label{sec:software_interfaces}

% Describe the connections between this product and other specific software 
% components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
% libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
% messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
% Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
% documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
% Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
% sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
% global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
% implementation constraint.
