\section{Assumptions and Dependencies} \label{sec:assumptions_dependencies}

% List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
% requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or 
% commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development 
% or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if 
% these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify 
% any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software 
% components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are 
% already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope 
% document or the project plan).

The OpenDiablo2 engine requires original Diablo II game files distributed by Blizzard.
The set of files is limited to the ".mpq" files that are normally found in the Diablo II Installation directory.

It is assumed that the end-user of the OpenDiablo2 engine owns a legally purchased copy of Diablo II.

As of writing, running the OpenDiablo2 engine depends wholly on the presence of the mpq files on the end-user's host machine.
